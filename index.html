	<p style="font-size:30px">Charge: I will charge 5$ per cat per day.</p>

	<p style="font-size:30px">My resume:  
	Experience: I have some experience with cat sitting. I have sat at Safe Haven before. Safe Haven is in Wells, Maine and is a no kill shelter for cats. I have also been around cats a lot. My aunt and uncle both have cats. 

	Education: I have gotten an A in every subject since letter grades were given out in 5th grade. I am a math apps student. Math apps is a high level math class. I have also taken Khan Academy couses at the 6th grade level in 5th grade and completed it. 

	What makes me unique: I am a black belt in karate and have been doing karate for 6 years (I also have been doing it for longer than I have not). I am also a snowboarder. My dad is a snowboard instructor at Pats Peak. I have been snowboarding for 5 years now.</p>

	<p style="font-size:30px">Covid-19: In your homes I will wear gloves and a mask for extra cleanliness.
