	<p style="font-size:30px">What I do: When someone is gone I go over to their house and sit for their cat. I play with that cat or cats, fill up the water and food, empty the litter box, water your plants, water your garden, and water your flowers for no extra charge. It you have other pets I will also tend to there needs.</p>
	<p style="font-size:30px">I also do dog walking!! I will come to your house as many times a week as you would like and take your dog on a walk.</p>
	<p style="font-size:30px">Purpose of this business: For people not to worry about their cat when they are gone on a trip.</p>
	<p style="font-size:30px">Charge: I will charge $10 per day. If you have 1 cat or 10 cats the price will always be $10.</p>
